## Introduction

ICRC-22 defines a standard way of representing payment requests on ICP as URIs. URIs can be embedded in QR codes, hyperlinks on Web pages, emails, or chat communication and serve the purpose of robust signalling between loosely-coupled applications. Such pre-canned or on-the-fly generated payment requests can be immediately used by the user's wallet application, where relevant parameters are provided by the URI and some other parameters may be filled in by the wallet application. This makes such URI encoding an indispensible tool in a larger blockchain ecosystem to allow for convenient communication of payment-related information over many different communication channels.

Relevant prior work in other blockchain ecosystems comprises the standards on payment URLs for Bitcoin \[Bit1, Bit2\] as well as Ethereum's [ERC-681 \[Nag17\]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-681.md) for expressing payment requests and, more generally, transactions using EVM ABI encoding, for the Ethereum blockchain. The specification put forth in ICRC-22 is an adaptation of the ideas in the abovelisted references to establish a standard way of sharing URIs that represent payment requests on the Internet Computer.

## Specification

The below specification defines the syntax and (non-formal) semantics for an ICRC-22 payment request. The specification takes the approaches of [Bit1, Bit2, Nag17, WLGH19] into consideration. Particularly, an authority-less URI format has been chosen following this prior art in the domain.

The following shows the structure of a URI for an example with the concrete parameters represented through `<>`-placeholders. Note that the URI does not contain an authority, but encodes the `network` as part of the URI path, directly following the URI scheme.
```
icp:<network>:<contract_address>/exec/<transaction>?from_subaccount=<subaccount>&to=<account>&amount=4.042E8&fee=<fee>&memo=<memo>
```

// FIX syntax details
ABNF syntax:
```
request = protocol ":" network ":" contract_address "/" "exec" transaction [ "?" parameters ]
protocol = "icp" ; always "icp" referring to the current version of the Internet Computer Protocol
network = (1..12)[0..9a..fA..F] / ; specifies the network through a prefix of its public key hash
contract_address = principal FIX: canister principal ABNF ; canister address to which to make the call
transaction = transfer / icrc1_transfer / icrc2_approve ; method on the canister to call
parameters = parameter [ "&" parameter ]
parameter = key "=" value
key = ...
value = ...
```

// FIX: Do we default the network to ICP's mainnet current value when omitted?
// Would result in `icp::<contract_address>/exec/<transaction>?`

// FIX: Should we keep it open to other methods and supported ICRCs as long as their API can be canonically expressed using a sequential list of parameters encoded as query parameters

The grammar productions not further specified can be looked up in the syntax specification for URIs in RFC 3986 [BFM05]. Note that the production `transaction` above is part of the path and `parameters` part of the query string and the according constraints of RFC 3986 apply.

The `network_identifier` uniquely identifies the network to make the transaction on. Following the ideas of the Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance [Cha24] of having a standardized way of referring to any blockchain network, ICP uses the following mechanism for referring to ICP mainnet or any other ICP-based network that may be available in the future, such as testnets or private networks based on the ICP protocol stack.
The network identifier for an ICP-based network is comprised of the constant `icp` referring to the Internet Computer Protocol, followed by `:`, followed by `<pub_key_hash_prefix>` where `pub_key_hash_prefix` is a ??-character prefix in ?? encoding of the SHA256 hash of the binary representation of the public key of the network. The prefix length and encoding scheme used ensures that the probability of collision is negligible for all practical purposes. For ICP mainnet the public key of the network is the NNS public key.
// FIX using base-64 encoding for the network allows for using a shorter prefix, which is crucial for usability and human readibility; prefix length t.b.d.

The `contract_address` is the canister smart contract principal identifier of the contract the transaction is to be performed on. This is represented in the standardized format for principals. The address, together with the network identifier, unambiguously determines the token that is to be transacted.

The constant `exec` means that the forthcoming part in the path component specifies which transaction (smart contract method) should be invoked with the information in the URI. In the future, other ICRC standards may emerge that can have a different string with different semantics in the place of this. // FIX: do we want to call this `tx`?

The `transaction` parameter specifies the canister method to be called on the canister indicated through `contract_address`. This is the string-based name as it appears in the canister's Candid specification. This standard requires support of all of ICP ledger's `transfer`, ICRC-1's `transfer` and ICRC-2's `approve` methods.

The `parameters` are the parameters of the method to be called. They SHOULD be given in the order in which they appear in the Candid specification of the method to be called. A subset of the parameters defind in the Candid specification of the method can be present, the remaining non-optional parameters MUST be filled in by the party executing the transaction.

// FIX: Details need to be worked out to make it possible to call different methods we want to cover in the base standard (at least ICP and ICRC-1 transfer and ICRC-2 approve). The result may not be so far away from a generic standard covering the call of any method of canisters. Specifically: Should types be decomposed into their constituents or the compound values be provided using a specific or their Candid encoding?

Next, we exhaustively define the parameters required for realizing the supported transactions of the supported ledger standards:
* `from_subaccount` (ICRC-1, ICRC-2): 32-byte subaccount in Base64 representation
* `to` (ICRC-1, ICRC-2): // FIX t.b.d.: The human readable [textual representation](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/TextualEncoding.md) of an ICRC-1 account or a shortened version thereof, e.g., with removed checksum or removed dashes between character groups, or using more concise encoding for parts.
* `spender` (ICRC-2): 
* `spender_subaccount` (ICRC-2): 
* `from` (ICRC-2): 
* `expected_allowance` (ICRC-2): 
* `expires_at` (ICRC-2): 
* `amount` (ICP, ICRC-1, ICRC-2): The transaction amount, specified in scientific representation, e.g., 4.042E8 means 804200000 base units of the addressed ledger.
* `fee` (ICP, ICRC-1, ICRC-2): Fee expressed in base units of the addressed ledger.
* `memo` (ICP, ICRC-1, ICRC-2): blob
* `created_at_time`: (ICP, ICRC-1, ICRC-2)
* ...
Accounts are always represented through the size-reduced textual encoding as specified in [the section](## Size-reduced-ICRC-1-textual-account-representation) below.
// FIX complete the list, define the respective encoding, maybe restructure per method

The `amount` should be provided as a nonnegative integer number. The amount represents the amount of tokens in the base unit used by the ledger, i.e., 4 ICP tokens would amount to 4 * 10^8 = 400000000 base units as managed by the ICP token ledger. It is strongly recommended to use scientific notation for the amount. Decimal representation can be combined with scientific representation, e.g., 4.042E8 ICP means a count of 404200000 base units as managed by the ICP ledger. As only integer numbers are allowed as amount, the exponent MUST be greater than or equal the decimal places of the number in scientific representation.

// FIX How exactly can the mapping from the paramters to the Candid method signature be done? Is it sufficient to enumerate all named parameters, with the type inferable by the recipient using the canister's Candid specification which can be obtained from the canister?

// FIX How to handle optional fields in the Candid specification of the method? As long as the input can be constructed unambiguously, they can be left out, otherwise be included as `key=null`.

## Size-reduced ICRC-1 textual account representation

// FIX maybe call "compressed"

The Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance [Cha24] has specified account identifiers to be of a maximum length of 128 characters [Gom22]. There seems to be no strong reason behind this, but it has been considered sufficient for the foreseeable future by the CAIP working group. This limitation cannot be changed at the current time.

ICRC-1 account identifiers on ICP may exceed this limitation by a few bytes when using the human-readable representation of ICRC-1 accounts, i.e., textual encoding of ICRC-1 accounts [Dfi22]. For this reason, we define a size-reduced textual ICRC-1 account representation as part of this standard in order to fit the CAIP limits of 128 characters. The size-reduced representation is easily computed by removing all the dashes ("-") between the character groups of the representation, except for the rightmost one (the one preceding the CRC32 checksum) for non-default accounts (non-zero subaccount). For default accounts (all-zero subaccount), all dashes are removed. It is easy to reconstruct the standard textual encoding from a size-reduced textual encoding by adding dash separators from the left of the representation for every 5-character group.

It is guaranteed that any ICRC-1 account in size-reduced representation fits into the 128-byte limit. The Internet Computer Interface Specification [Dfi] specifies the maximum lenght of a textual representation of a principal to be 63 bytes, which includes 10 dashes. The additional CRC-32 checksum in Base-32 encoding takes another 7 characters, its dash separator one. This makes the maximum length of the size-reduced representation 126 characters: 63 for the maximum-length principal in textual encoding - 10 for separators + 1 for the "-"-separator + 7 for the CRC32 checksum + 1 for the "."-separator + 64 for the subaccount in hexadecimal representation.

The following is an example of an almost maximum-length textual representation that exceeds the size limits imposed by CAIP with its 135 characters.
```
k2t6j-2nvnp-4zjm3-25dtz-6xhaa-c7boj-5gayf-oj3xs-i43lp-teztq-6ae-dfxgiyy.102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f20
```
The following is the above example in size-reduced form and fits within the 128-character limit with its 124 characters.
```
k2t6j2nvnp4zjm325dtz6xhaac7boj5gayfoj3xsi43lpteztq6aedfxgiyy.102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f20
```

// FIX use maximum-length textual account representation as example; the current one is close

## Examples

The following examples show the application of ICRC-22 for ICP transfer, ICRC-1 transfer, and ICRC-2 approval use cases.

### ICRC-1 token transfer

// FIX replace 1234abcd90 with a prefix of the SHA256 hash of the mainnet NNS public key in binary

// FIX fill in subaccounts etc. with accounts in the proper format

The following is a payment request for 4.042 ckBTC on the ckBTC ledger. The wallet reading and executing this request would insert the `created_at_time` field based on the current time.
```
icp:1234abcd90:mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai/exec/icrc1_transfer?from_subaccount=10&to=k2t6j2nvnp4zjm325dtz6xhaac7boj5gayfoj3xsi43lpteztq6aedfxgiyy.102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f20&amount=4.042E8&memo=receipt%2012345678
```

### ICP token transfer

// FIX
```
icp:1234abcd90:<icp_contract_address>/exec/transfer?from_subaccount=<subaccount>&to=<icp_address>&amount=4.042E8&fee=<fee>&memo=<memo>&created_at_time=<timestamp>
```

### ICRC-2 approval

An ICRC-2 approval can be made on any ICRC-2-compliant ledger, e.g., the ICP ledger or any ICRC-1-compliant token ledger.

```
icp:1234abcd90:<icrc1_contract_address>/exec/icrc2_approve?from_subaccount=<subaccount>&spender=<spender_account>&amount=<amount>&expected_allowance=<allowance>&...
```

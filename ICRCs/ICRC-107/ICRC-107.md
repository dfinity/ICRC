# ICRC-107: Fee Collection

## Introduction & Motivation

Different ICRC-based ledgers (e.g., ckBTC) handle fee collection inconsistently. Some ledgers assign a designated fee collector for transfer operations, while others burn fees for approve operationsâ€”even when fee collection details appear in approve blocks. This inconsistency leads to challenges in defining fee collection rules, recording fee settings on-chain, and ensuring clear semantics for wallets and explorers. ICRC-107 builds on the ICRC-3 block schema, introducing a new block type (`107feecol`) to configure fee collection settings on-chain. This ensures compatibility with existing ICRC-3 implementations while extending functionality for fee handling.
By embedding fee collection settings on-chain, ICRC-107 provides the following benefits:

- Transparency: Fee collection rules are visible and auditable on the ledger.

- Interoperability: Wallets and explorers can rely on consistent fee handling across ICRC-based ledgers.

- Simplified Integration: Eliminates the need for off-chain metadata to determine fee collection behavior.

ICRC-107 applies to all ICRC-based ledgers ensuring consistent fee collection behavior across transfers and approvals. This standard is backward-compatible with existing ICRC-based ledgers, allowing them to transition gradually to the new fee collection mechanism, while documenting legacy fee collection logic.

### ICRC-107 Proposal

ICRC-107 establishes an on-chain fee collection mechanism that ensures clarity and interoperability across different ICRC-based ledgers. It defines:

- A fee collection configuration that specifies the collector account (`icrc107_fee_col`), applying to all subsequent blocks.
- A new block type for setting `icrc107_fee_col` to designate the fee collector.
- A backward-compatible mechanism where, until `icrc107_fee_col` is set, legacy `fee_col` logic applies.

By embedding fee collection settings entirely on-chain, ICRC-107 ensures transparency and simplifies integration with external tools.


## Common Elements
This standard follows the conventions set by ICRC-3, inheriting key structural components.
- **Accounts** are represented using the ICRC-3 `Value` type, specifically as a `variant { Array = vec { V1 [, V2] } }` where `V1` is `variant { Blob = <owner_principal> }` representing the account owner, and `V2` is `variant { Blob = <subaccount> }` representing the subaccount. If no subaccount is specified, the `Array` MUST contain only one element (`V1`, the owner's principal).
- **Principals** (such as the `caller`) are represented using the ICRC-3 `Value` type as `variant { Blob = <principal_bytes> }`.
- Each block includes `phash`, a `Blob` representing the hash of the parent block, and `ts`, a `Nat` representing the timestamp of the block.

##  Fee Collection

### Overview

Each block requires a fee, which a designated party must pay based on the operation type.

The fee collection configuration controls how the ledger processes fees. This configuration consists of a single global fee collector account (`icrc107_fee_col`). When a block updates this setting, the change takes effect immediately.

- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to a ledger account, that account collects all subsequent fees.
- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to the empty account (see below), the ledger burns all subsequent fees.
- An `icrc107_fee_col` block configures the fee collection for all subsequent blocks, until superseded by another `icrc107_fee_col` block.
- Until `icrc107_fee_col` is set fees are burned, unless legacy `fee_col` logic applies (see Section 5).
- A **fee collector configuration block** records these settings on-chain, ensuring transparent fee collection.

Once `icrc107_fee_col` is set, it overrides any legacy fee collection logic that may be in place (See Section 5).

Fee burning is explicitly recorded on-chain by setting `icrc107_fee_col = variant { Array = vec {} }`. This ensures unambiguous representation across implementations.




### ICRC-107 Transaction and Block Schema

Each `107feecol` block consists of the following top-level fields:

| Field             | Type (ICRC-3 `Value`) | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `btype`           | `Text`                 | Yes      | **MUST** be `"107feecol"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `ts`              | `Nat`                  | Yes      | Timestamp (in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch) when the block was added to the ledger.                                                                                                                                                |
| `phash`           | `Blob`                 | Yes      | Hash of the parent block.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `tx`              | `Map(Text, Value)`     | Yes      | Encodes information about the fee collection configuration transaction. See `tx` Field Schema below.                                                                                                                                   |


### `tx` Field Schema

The `tx` field for a `107feecol` block is a `Map` that contains the following fields:

| Field           | Type (ICRC-3 `Value`) | Required | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `op`            | `Text`                 | Yes      | **MUST** be `"set107feecol"`. Explicitly identifies the operation and standard within the transaction, enabling self-contained transaction records and unambiguous hashing. |
| `fee_col` | `Array` (Account)      | Yes      | The target fee collector account. If `variant { Array = vec {} }`, it signifies that fees should be burned. See Common Elements for Account representation. |
| `created_at_time` | `Nat`                | Yes      | Timestamp (in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch) when the user created the transaction. This value **MUST** be provided by the caller to enable transaction deduplication as per ICRC-1. |
| `caller` |  `Blob` | Yes | The principal of the user or canister that originated this transaction. |





#### Example Block

Below is an example of a valid **fee collector configuration block** that sets the fee collector to a specific account:

```
variant { Map = vec {
    // Block type: indicates this is a fee collector configuration block
    record { "btype"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }};
    // The user's intended transaction
    record { "tx"; variant { Map = vec {
        record { "op"; variant { Text = "107setfeecol" } }; // Operation name, as per schema
        record { "fee_col"; variant { Array = vec {
            variant { Blob = blob "\00\00\00\00\02\00\01\0d\01\01"}; // Owner principal
            variant { Blob = blob "\06\ec\cd\3a\97\fb\a8\5f\bc\8d\a3\3e\5d\ba\bc\2f\38\69\60\5d\c7\a1\c9\53\1f\70\a3\66\c5\a7\e4\21" }; // Subaccount
        }} };
        record { "created_at_time"; variant { Nat = 1_750_951_727_000_000_000 : nat } }; // Timestamp for deduplication (June 27, 2025, 15:28:47 UTC)
        record { "caller"; variant { Blob = blob "\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\01\01" } }; // Example caller principal
    }} };
    // Timestamp: indicates when the block was created
    record { "ts"; variant { Nat = 1_741_312_737_184_874_392 : nat } }; // Existing block timestamp
    // Parent hash: links this block to the previous block in the chain
    record { "phash";
              variant {
                Blob = blob "\d5\c7\eb\57\a2\4e\fa\d4\8b\d1\cc\54\9e\49\c6\9f\d1\93\8d\e8\02\d4\60\65\e2\f2\3c\00\04\3b\2e\51"
              }};
}};
```
If one wanted to set the fee collector to be the default account of principal identified by `"\00\00\00\00\02\00\01\0d\01\01"`, then the "fee_col" field within `tx`  should be set to variant ``{ Array = vec {
    variant { Blob = blob "\00\00\00\00\02\00\01\0d\01\01"} } }``.



A block that explicitly sets fee burning by removing the fee collector (i.e., all fees are burned from this point onward):

```
variant { Map = vec {
    // Block type: indicates this is a fee collector configuration block
    record { "btype"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }};
    // The user's intended transaction, from which the hash is computed
    record { "tx"; variant { Map = vec {
        record { "op"; variant { Text = "set107feecol" } }; // Operation name, as per schema
        record { "fee_col"; variant { Array = vec {
                // Empty array to signify burning fees
            }}};
        record { "created_at_time"; variant { Nat = 1_750_951_728_000_000_000 : nat } }; // Timestamp for deduplication (incremented from previous example)
        record { "caller"; variant { Blob = blob "\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\01\01" } }; // Example caller principal
    }} };
    // Timestamp: indicates when the block was created (can be derived from tx.created_at_time or ledger time)
    record { "ts"; variant { Nat = 1_741_312_737_184_874_392 : nat } }; // Existing block timestamp
    // Parent hash: links this block to the previous block in the chain
    record { "phash";
              variant {
                Blob = blob "\2d\86\7f\34\c7\2d\1e\2d\00\84\10\a4\00\b0\b6\4c\3e\02\96\c9\e8\55\6f\dd\72\68\e8\df\8d\8e\8a\ee"
              }};
}};
```

# ICRC-107: Methods for Setting and Getting Fee Collection

## Methods for Setting and Getting Fee Collection

### `icrc107_set_fee_collection`

This method allows a ledger controller to update the fee collection settings. It modifies the `icrc107_fee_col` account, which determines where collected fees are sent. The updated settings are recorded in a new block (of type `107feecol`) added to the ledger.

```

type Account = record {
    owner: principal;
    subaccount: opt blob;
};

type SetFeeCollectionArgs = record {
    icrc107_fee_col: opt Account;
    created_at_time: opt nat64;
};

type SetFeeCollectionError = variant {
    AccessDenied : text; // The caller is not authorized to modify fee collection settings.
    InvalidAccount : text; // The provided account for fee collection is invalid (e.g., minting account, anonymous principal, malformed).
    Duplicate : record { duplicate_of : nat }; // A duplicate transaction already exists at position `duplicate_of` in the ledger.
    GenericError : record { error_code : nat; message : text };
};

icrc107_set_fee_collection: (SetFeeCollectionRequest) -> (variant { Ok: empty; Err: SetFeeCollectionError });

```

This method MUST only be callable by a controller of the ledger or some other authorized principals. Unauthorized calls SHOULD result in an error.

- The ledger MUST construct the tx field (an ICRC-3 Value of type Map as described in the previous section) from this request, place it in the generated `107feecol` block and append the block to the ledger.
- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to an account, all subsequent fees are collected by that account.
- If `icrc107_fee_col` is not provided (or set to `null`), all subsequent fees are burned.

The `icrc107_set_fee_collection` method MUST return an error in the following cases:

- The caller is not authorized to modify fee collection settings.
- The provided `Account` is invalid (e.g., the minting account on ledgers,  anonymous principal, malformed principal or subaccount)."
- Transaction deduplication is enabled for the transaction (i.e. `created_at_time` is set) and an identical transaction already exist.


### `icrc107_get_fee_collection`

This method retrieves the currently active fee collection settings. Unless changed, these settings apply to the next block added to the ledger.

```
icrc107_get_fee_collection: () -> (variant { Ok: opt Account; Err: record { error_code : nat; message : text } }) query;
```


This method should return the currently active fee collection settings:

  - If the response is `null`, fees are burned. This corresponds to `icrc107_fee_col = variant { Array = vec {}}` on-chain.
  - If the response is a valid `Account`, fees are collected by that account. This corresponds to `icrc107_fee_col` being set to the ICRC-3 representation of the account on-chain.

This method strictly returns the last explicitly set value of `icrc107_fee_col`. It does not infer defaults, and if no fee collector was ever set, it returns `opt Account = null`.

---


##  Reporting Compliance

Compliance with the current standard is reported as follows.

###  Supported Standards

Ledgers implementing ICRC-107 **MUST** indicate their compliance through the `icrc1_supported_standards` and `icrc10_supported_standards` methods, by including in the output of these methods:

```
variant { Vec = vec {
    record {
        "name"; variant { Text = "ICRC-107" };
        "url"; variant { Text = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-107.md" };
    }
}};
```

###  Supported Block Types

Ledgers implementing ICRC-107 **MUST** report the new block type in response  to `icrc3_supported_block_types`.  The output of the call must include

```
variant { Vec = vec {
    record { "name"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }; "url"; variant { Text = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-107.md" } };
}};
```

##  Note on Legacy Fee Collection Mechanisms

The Dfinity maintained ICRC ledgers include a fee collection mechanism which, for completeness is described below.

###  Legacy Behavior (`fee_col`)


- Until `icrc107_fee_col` is set, the ledger follows this legacy behavior, using `fee_col` only for transfers.
- If `fee_col`is not set, all fees are burned.
- If `fee_col` is set in a block, the designated account collects only transfer fees (`1xfer`, `2xfer`). Fees for all other operations (e.g., `2approve`) were always burned in legacy behavior as implemented in Dfinity-maintained ICRC-3 ledgers.


New implementations SHOULD avoid using `fee_col` and instead use `icrc107_fee_col` for all fee collection settings. Legacy behavior is provided for backward compatibility only and MAY be deprecated in future versions of this standard.

###  Handling Fee Collection for ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 Blocks

To determine who collects the fee in a block:

1. Check for fee collection configuration

   - If a previous block set `icrc107_fee_col`, the ledger uses the behavior specified by this standard.

2. If no `icrc107_fee_col` setting exists (legacy behavior):

   - If the block is of type `2approve` then the fee is burned
   - If the block is a transfer block, i.e. of type `1xfer` or `2xfer`:
      - If `fee_col` is specified in the block the fee is collected by `fee_col`.
      - If `fee_col_block` is specified use the `fee_col` from the referenced block index.

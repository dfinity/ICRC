# ICRC-107: Fee Collection

## 1. Introduction & Motivation

Different ICRC-based ledgers (e.g., ckBTC) handle fee collection inconsistently. Some ledgers assign a designated fee collector for transfer operations, while others burn fees for approve operationsâ€”even when fee collection details appear in approve blocks. This inconsistency leads to challenges in defining fee collection rules, recording fee settings on-chain, and ensuring clear semantics for wallets and explorers. ICRC-107 builds on the ICRC-3 block schema, introducing a new block type (`107feecol`) to configure fee collection settings on-chain. This ensures compatibility with existing ICRC-3 implementations while extending functionality for fee handling.
By embedding fee collection settings on-chain, ICRC-107 provides the following benefits:

- Transparency: Fee collection rules are visible and auditable on the ledger.

- Interoperability: Wallets and explorers can rely on consistent fee handling across ICRC-based ledgers.

- Simplified Integration: Eliminates the need for off-chain metadata to determine fee collection behavior.

ICRC-107 applies to all ICRC-based ledgers ensuring consistent fee collection behavior across transfers and approvals. This standard is backward-compatible with existing ICRC-based ledgers, allowing them to transition gradually to the new fee collection mechanism, while documenting legacy fee collection logic.

### ICRC-107 Proposal

ICRC-107 establishes an on-chain fee collection mechanism that ensures clarity and interoperability across different ICRC-based ledgers. It defines:

- A fee collection configuration that specifies the collector account (`icrc107_fee_col`), applying to all subsequent blocks.
- A new block type for setting `icrc107_fee_col` to designate the fee collector.
- A backward-compatible mechanism where, until `icrc107_fee_col` is set, legacy `fee_col` logic applies.

By embedding fee collection settings entirely on-chain, ICRC-107 ensures transparency and simplifies integration with external tools.

## 2. Fee Collection

### 2.1 Overview

Each block requires a fee, which a designated party must pay based on the operation type.

The fee collection configuration controls how the ledger processes fees. This configuration consists of a single global fee collector account (`icrc107_fee_col`). When a block updates this setting, the change takes effect immediately.

- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to a ledger account, that account collects all subsequent fees.
- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to the empty account (see below), the ledger burns all subsequent fees.
- An `icrc107_fee_col` block configures the fee collection for all subsequent blocks, until superseded by another `icrc107_fee_col` block. 
- Until `icrc107_fee_col` is set fees are burned, unless legacy `fee_col` logic applies (see Section 5).
- A **fee collector configuration block** records these settings on-chain, ensuring transparent fee collection.

Once `icrc107_fee_col` is set, it overrides any legacy fee collection logic that may be in place (See Section 5).

Fee burning is explicitly recorded on-chain by setting `icrc107_fee_col = variant { Array = vec {} }`. This ensures unambiguous representation across implementations.


### 2.2 ICRC-107 Block Schema

ICRC-107 introduces a new block type that follows the ICRC-3 specification to configure `icrc107_fee_col`.

In addition to the ICRC-3 specific requirements, a fee collector configuration block:

- **MUST** contain a field `btype` with value `"107feecol"`.
- **MUST** contain a field `icrc107_fee_col` of type `Array`, specifying the owner and, optionally, a subaccount, following the ICRC-3 standard.
- To explicitly burn fees, `icrc107_fee_col` **MUST** be set to `variant { Array = vec {}}`.

#### Example Block

Below is an example of a valid **fee collector configuration block** that sets the fee collector to a specific account:

```
variant { Map = vec {
    // Block type: indicates this is a fee collector configuration block
    record { "btype"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }};
    // Fee collector account: specifies the account that will collect fees
    record { "icrc107_fee_col"; variant { Array = vec {
        variant { Blob = blob "\00\00\00\00\02\00\01\0d\01\01"}; // Owner principal
        variant { Blob = blob "\06\ec\cd\3a\97\fb\a8\5f\bc\8d\a3\3e\5d\ba\bc\2f\38\69\60\5d\c7\a1\c9\53\1f\70\a3\66\c5\a7\e4\21" }; // Subaccount
    }} };
    // Timestamp: indicates when the block was created
    record { "ts"; variant { Nat = 1_741_312_737_184_874_392 : nat } };
    // Parent hash: links this block to the previous block in the chain
    record { "phash";
              variant {
                Blob = blob "\d5\c7\eb\57\a2\4e\fa\d4\8b\d1\cc\54\9e\49\c6\9f\d1\93\8d\e8\02\d4\60\65\e2\f2\3c\00\04\3b\2e\51"
              }};
}};
```

A block that explicitly sets fee burning by removing the fee collector (i.e., all fees are burned from this point onward):

```
variant { Map = vec {
    record { "btype"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }};
    record { "icrc107_fee_col"; variant { Array = vec {
            }}};
    record { "ts"; variant { Nat = 1_741_312_737_184_874_392 : nat } };
    record { "phash";
              variant {
                Blob = blob "\2d\86\7f\34\c7\2d\1e\2d\00\84\10\a4\00\b0\b6\4c\3e\02\96\c9\e8\55\6f\dd\72\68\e8\df\8d\8e\8a\ee"
              }};
}};
```

# ICRC-107: Methods for Setting and Getting Fee Collection

## 3. Methods for Setting and Getting Fee Collection

### 3.1 `icrc107_set_fee_collection`

This method allows a ledger controller to update the fee collection settings. It modifies the `icrc107_fee_col` account, which determines where collected fees are sent. The updated settings are recorded in a new block (of type `107feecol`) added to the ledger.

```
icrc107_set_fee_collection: (SetFeeCollectionRequest) -> ();
```

#### Request Type:
```
type Account = record {
    owner: principal;
    subaccount: opt blob;
};

type SetFeeCollectionRequest = record {
    icrc107_fee_col: opt Account;
};
```

This method MUST only be callable by the ledger controller or authorized principals. Unauthorized calls SHOULD result in an error.

- If `icrc107_fee_col` is set to an account, all subsequent fees are collected by that account.
- If `icrc107_fee_col` is not provided (or set to `null`), all subsequent fees are burned.

The `icrc107_set_fee_collection` method MUST return an error in the following cases:

- The caller is not authorized to modify fee collection settings.
- The provided `Account` is invalid (e.g., the minting account on ledgers,  anonymous principal, malformed principal or subaccount)."


### 3.2 `icrc107_get_fee_collection`

This method retrieves the currently active fee collection settings. Unless changed, these settings apply to the next block added to the ledger.

```
icrc107_get_fee_collection: () -> (opt Account) query;
```


This method should return the currently active fee collection settings:

  - If the response is `null`, fees are burned. This corresponds to `icrc107_fee_col = variant { Array = vec {}}` on-chain.
  - If the response is a valid `Account`, fees are collected by that account. This corresponds to `icrc107_fee_col` being set to the ICRC-3 representation of the account on-chain.

This method strictly returns the last explicitly set value of `icrc107_fee_col`. It does not infer defaults, and if no fee collector was ever set, it returns `opt Account = null`.

## 4. Reporting Compliance

Compliance with the current standard is reported as follows.

### 4.1 Supported Standards

Ledgers implementing ICRC-107 **MUST** indicate their compliance through the `icrc1_supported_standards` and `icrc10_supported_standards` methods, by including in the output of these methods:

```
variant { Vec = vec {
    record {
        "name"; variant { Text = "ICRC-107" };
        "url"; variant { Text = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-107.md" };
    }
}};
```

### 4.2 Supported Block Types

Ledgers implementing ICRC-107 **MUST** report the new block type in response  to `icrc3_supported_block_types`.  The output of the call must include

```
variant { Vec = vec {
    record { "name"; variant { Text = "107feecol" }; "url"; variant { Text = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-107.md" } };
}};
```

## 5. Note on Legacy Fee Collection Mechanisms

The Dfinity maintained ICRC ledgers include a fee collection mechanism which, for completeness is described below.

### 5.1 Legacy Behavior (`fee_col`)


- Until `icrc107_fee_col` is set, the ledger follows this legacy behavior, using `fee_col` only for transfers.
- If `fee_col`is not set, all fees are burned.
- If `fee_col` is set in a block, the designated account collects only transfer fees (`1xfer`, `2xfer`). Fees for all other operations (e.g., `2approve`) were always burned in legacy behavior as implemented in Dfinity-maintained ICRC-3 ledgers.


New implementations SHOULD avoid using `fee_col` and instead use `icrc107_fee_col` for all fee collection settings. Legacy behavior is provided for backward compatibility only and MAY be deprecated in future versions of this standard.

### 5.2 Handling Fee Collection for ICRC-1 and ICRC-2 Blocks

To determine who collects the fee in a block:

1. Check for fee collection configuration

   - If a previous block set `icrc107_fee_col`, the ledger uses the behavior specified by this standard.

2. If no `icrc107_fee_col` setting exists (legacy behavior):

   - If the block is of type `2approve` then the fee is burned
   - If the block is a transfer block, i.e. of type `1xfer` or `2xfer`:
      - If `fee_col` is specified in the block the fee is collected by `fee_col`.
      - If `fee_col_block` is specified use the `fee_col` from the referenced block index.

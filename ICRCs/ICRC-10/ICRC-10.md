ICRC-10 is a standard aimed at simplifying the discovery of the supported standards of canisters on the Internet Computer. By providing a unified method, `icrc10_supported_standards`, canisters can easily expose the standards they implement, enhancing interoperability and easing integration efforts across the ecosystem.

## Data

The `icrc10_supported_standards` method returns a list of standardized records, each corresponding to a standard supported by the canister. The response record format of this method is structured as follows:

```candid "Type definitions" +=
type SupportedStandard = record { name : text; url : text; };
type SupportedStandardsResponse = vec SupportedStandard;
```

### name

For ICRC standards the text SHOULD be in the form `ICRC-X` where `X` is the official ICRC number assigned at https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/issues. New ICRC numbers can be procured by filing an issue at https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/issues/new. The resulting issue number MUST be used for numbering the new ICRC standard.

For non-ICRC standards, the text SHOULD be a human-readable namespace with a small likelihood of collision. The Internet Computer shares a global namespace. Please be polite to other developers and make namespaces specific. See https://forum.dfinity.org/t/prefix-all-the-methods-of-the-icrc-1-token-standard-with-icrc1/13865 for more discussion.

Suggestions:

- com.search.searchable
- org.icdevs.donatable
- eth.ecrc20.addressable

### url

The url SHOULD point to a stable URL that explains the referenced standard.

## Methods

### icrc10_supported_standards

Standard developers MUST implement the `icrc10_supported_standards` query endpoint.

The method returns a list of standards supported by the canister.

The method is used for discovering which APIs or protocols a given canister complies with, making it easier for developers and applications to interact with a broad range of services on the Internet Computer without prior detailed knowledge of each service's capabilities.

```candid "Methods" +=
icrc10_supported_standards : () -> (SupportedStandardsResponse) query;
```

The result MUST include entries for `ICRC-1` if the canister supports these standards. This mandate ensures that clients querying for supported standards can upgrade to ICRC-10 for discoverability. 

The result MUST include a self-reference for `record{name="ICRC-10"; url="https://github.com/dfinity/ICRCs/ICRC-10"}`.

Additionally, the result SHOULD include entries for other supported standards, offering a flexible and extensible way to advertise capabilities.

## Rationale

The rationale behind the `icrc10_supported_standards` method over implementing similar endpoints within ICRC-1 individually is that it alleviates the need for ICRC standard writers to include custom specifications for a feature retrieval endpoint. This approach streamlines the integration process, broadens the compatibility across different protocols, and fosters a more interconnected and versatile ecosystem.

In effect, `icrc10_supported_standards` serves as a universal discovery mechanism, enabling canisters to succinctly communicate their supported interfaces. This capability is particularly valuable in a decentralized environment like the Internet Computer, where discovering and leveraging the functionalities of various services can significantly enhance application development and user experiences.

Through standardization of the `icrc10_supported_standards` method, ICRC-10 aims to simplify interoperability, reduce implementation complexity, and foster a more vibrant and accessible ecosystem of services on the Internet Computer.

## Migration Path for Ledgers Using ICRC-1

Ledgers and other services that already exist, to the extent that they are capable, SHOULD implement ICRC-10 to increase interoperability on the Internet Computer.

For maintaining interoperability with ICRC-1, existing ICRC-1 ledgers MUST maintain their implementation of  `icrc1_supported_standards`.  The new `icrc10_supported_standards` method SHOULD return at least the same data, but MAY be augmented with additional ICRC features or supported standards.

## Versioning

Generally, new versions and updates of existing standards SHOULD be assigned a new ICRC number as opposed to attempting to support versioning through this interface.

## Future Work

A  potential area for improvement is the establishment of a registry or directory service on the Internet Computer that indexes canisters by the standards they support, using the ICRC-10 mechanism. Such a service could dramatically improve discoverability and foster a more interconnected ecosystem of canisters.
